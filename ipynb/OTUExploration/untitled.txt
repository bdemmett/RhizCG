       Only OTUs with a log2 transformed relative abundance above 5 ‰ in at least one sample were included in the analysis.
       Note that beta-diversity calculations were done on un-rarified counts

       Low abundance OTUs were eliminated from the
124 OTU table if they did not have a total of at least 5 counts across all the samples in the experiment.
